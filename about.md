I am a graduate student at McGill University and am currently working on my thesis in the Sable research lab. My work involves compiling array-based languages such as Matlab and Python (with the numpy library) to C++ and OpenCL code. This work is part of the McLab project. More information on my research as well as the McLab research can be found on the [McLab](http://www.sable.mcgill.ca/mclab/) website .

My primary interests are in compilers, parallel programming and architectures and distributed systems. My projects can be on [github](https://github.com/sameerjagdale). My non-academic interests include reading, travelling and extreme procrastination.
